## Challenge

Municipal corporations struggle with fragmented infrastructure data scattered across multiple departments—water, electricity, roads, sewerage. This creates:

- **Coordination failures** and delays in development approvals (90-180 days)
- **Frequent utility strikes** during excavations
- **Incomplete property tax coverage**
- **Siloed departmental databases** preventing unified asset views
- **High proprietary GIS licensing costs** (₹20-50 lakh annually)

## Our Solution

**Integrated 3D GIS & Digital Twin Platform** combining all municipal infrastructure into a unified spatial database with real-time visualization, predictive analytics, and citizen-facing services.

### Technology Stack

- **PostGIS/PostgreSQL** for centralized asset repository
- **GeoServer** for publishing spatial data services (WMS, WFS, WMTS)
- **CesiumJS 3D digital twin** for photorealistic city visualization
- **React Native mobile apps** for field inspections
- **Cloud deployment** (AWS/Azure) with auto-scaling
- **IoT sensor integration** for real-time monitoring

### Key Capabilities

#### Unified Infrastructure Asset Map
Single spatial database showing all underground and above-ground utilities—water pipes, electric cables, sewer lines, telecom networks, road infrastructure. Before excavations, contractors query the system to identify utility conflicts, preventing strikes and coordinating multi-department maintenance.

#### 3D Digital Twin for Planning
Photorealistic 3D city models enable stakeholders to visualize proposed developments before construction. Shadow analysis, viewshed studies, and building setback compliance checks accelerate development plan approvals.

#### Real-Time Smart City Dashboard
GIS-integrated command center displays live sensor data, emergency incidents, and asset locations on interactive maps. Emergency responders receive optimized routes considering real-time traffic and road closures.

#### Automated Building Permission Workflow
Upload georeferenced building plans for automatic compliance checks—setback validation, FSI calculations, fire station proximity, heritage zone restrictions. Streamlines approval workflows from 90-180 days to 28-45 days.

#### Revenue Enhancement Through Asset Discovery
Annual drone surveys update building footprints. AI change detection identifies new constructions not yet in property tax records, expanding the tax base.

## Benefits

### Operational Efficiency
- **Infrastructure coordination** prevents excavation conflicts
- **Faster approvals**: 90-180 days → 28-45 days for development plans
- **Emergency response optimization** with GIS-based routing
- **Asset management maturity**: reactive → predictive maintenance

### Strategic Value
- **Data-driven planning** with comprehensive spatial intelligence
- **Transparency & governance** through citizen-accessible portals
- **Revenue protection & growth** via complete property mapping
- **Audit trails** documenting all spatial decisions

## Implementation Approach

### Pilot Phase (3 Months)
- Single municipal ward or smart city area (10-20 sq km)
- Integrate departmental data into PostGIS
- Deploy web GIS dashboard and 3D visualization
- Develop mobile field inspection app
- Train 15-20 municipal staff

### Full Deployment (8-10 Months)
- Citywide data integration and expansion
- ICCC real-time sensor integration
- Citizen-facing services (property tax portals, complaints)
- Training for 100-200 municipal staff

## Target Clients

- **Large Municipal Corporations**: Cities with 1M+ population
- **Smart City SPVs**: India's 100 Smart Cities Mission participants
- **Urban Development Authorities**: AUDA, SUDA, and similar planning authorities
- **Infrastructure Developers**: Real estate, metro projects requiring GIS
