## Challenge

Mining lease compliance monitoring difficult with traditional methods. Stockpile volume measurement time-consuming and inaccurate. Environmental impact assessment lacks spatial precision.

## Our Solution

**Drone-Based Mining Monitoring System** using photogrammetry for 3D models, volumetric calculations, and automated change detection for compliance tracking.

### Technology Stack

- **Drone photogrammetry** for detailed site surveys
- **Volumetric calculations** for accurate stockpile measurement
- **Change detection algorithms** for environmental monitoring
- **Permit boundary overlays** for compliance verification
- **AI for unauthorized mining detection**

### Key Capabilities

- Accurate stockpile measurement for royalty calculation
- Environmental compliance documentation
- Safety monitoring of slope stability
- Regulatory reporting automation

## Benefits

- **Accurate stockpile measurement** within Â±2-3% error margin
- **Environmental compliance documentation** with geo-referenced evidence
- **Safety monitoring** through periodic structural analysis
- **Regulatory reporting automation** saving time and resources

## Target Clients

Mining companies, state geology departments, mineral licensing authorities, environmental compliance agencies.

## Get Started

Ensure mining compliance and accurate royalty calculations with drone-based monitoring.
