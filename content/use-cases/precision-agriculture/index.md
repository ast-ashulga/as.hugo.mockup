## Challenge

Agricultural departments and farmers need timely, field-level insights for crop health assessment, irrigation planning, and yield forecasting. Traditional challenges include:

- **Manual field visits** covering limited areas with delayed information
- **Lack of scientific data** for precision input application
- **Over-use of water and fertilizers**, reducing profitability
- **Weeks-long crop damage assessment** for insurance claims
- **Farm boundary disputes** due to poorly documented land parcels

## Our Solution

**AI-Powered Precision Agriculture Platform** combining multispectral drone surveys, satellite imagery analysis, and IoT sensor integration to deliver field-level crop health intelligence and precision farming recommendations.

### Technology Stack

- **Multispectral drone surveys** capturing RGB + NIR imagery
- **Satellite imagery** (Sentinel-2, Landsat) for large-area monitoring
- **NDVI, EVI, SAVI calculations** for crop health and stress detection
- **AI crop type classification** using machine learning
- **Mobile app** for farmers with field-level advisories in local language
- **Integration with PM-KISAN and crop insurance systems**

### Key Capabilities

#### Crop Health Monitoring
Generate vegetation health maps showing within-field variability. Identify stress zones (water stress, nutrient deficiency, pest/disease infestation) before visible symptoms appear. Time-series analysis tracks crop development compared to historical norms.

#### Precision Irrigation Planning
Soil moisture mapping combined with crop water requirements identifies areas needing irrigation. Optimize water application timing and volume. Support drip irrigation system design with field topography analysis.

#### Farm Boundary Management
RTK drone surveys establish accurate farm boundaries with centimeter-level precision. Digital land records reduce boundary disputes. Support PM-KISAN beneficiary verification and subsidy disbursement.

#### Crop Damage Assessment
Rapid post-disaster assessment (hail, flood, drought) using before/after satellite imagery comparison. Automated damage percentage calculation at field level. Accelerate insurance claim processing from weeks to days.

#### Advisory Services
Field-specific recommendations for fertilizer application based on NDVI zones. Pest/disease risk alerts based on weather conditions and crop stage. Market linkage support through crop area estimation and harvest forecasting.

## Benefits

### For Farmers
- **Increased yields**: Early stress detection enables timely interventions
- **Cost savings**: 20-30% water reduction, optimized fertilizer use
- **Faster insurance claims**: Weeks â†’ days for damage assessment
- **Scientific decision support**: Data-driven farming replaces guesswork

### For Agriculture Department
- **Scalable monitoring**: Cover entire district/state with satellite imagery
- **Subsidy management**: Verify crop type and area for PM-KISAN
- **Policy planning**: Accurate crop acreage and yield estimates
- **Targeted interventions**: Optimize resource allocation based on real data

## Implementation Approach

### Pilot Phase (One Agricultural Season - 4-6 Months)
- 1-2 talukas covering 5,000-10,000 hectares
- Baseline data collection and sensor deployment
- Bi-weekly satellite imagery analysis
- Monthly drone surveys for ground truth validation
- Mobile app with 500+ registered farmers

### Scaling Strategy
- District-wide satellite monitoring
- Multi-crop coverage and seasonal calendars
- Integration with state agriculture department systems
- Network of weather stations and reference farms

## Use Case Scenarios

### Early Pest Infestation Detection
**Traditional**: Farmers notice symptoms after 15-20% crop loss
**With Setu GIS**: Bi-weekly NDVI detects stress before visible symptoms. SMS alert enables early intervention, limiting damage to 2-3%

### Precision Irrigation Scheduling
**Traditional**: Calendar-based watering wastes water and reduces yield
**With Setu GIS**: Soil moisture mapping + crop model delivers zone-specific recommendations. 20-30% water savings with improved crop growth

### Rapid Crop Insurance Claims
**Traditional**: Manual assessment takes 3-4 weeks, compensation delayed months
**With Setu GIS**: Satellite-based automated damage assessment within one week. Farmer compensation accelerated from 3-4 months to 3-4 weeks

## Target Clients

- **State Agriculture Departments**: District crop monitoring and subsidy verification
- **Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)**: Member farm monitoring and collective services
- **Agribusiness**: Seed/fertilizer companies, demonstration plot monitoring
- **Crop Insurance Companies**: Automated damage assessment and fraud detection
