## Challenge

Forest health monitoring over large areas resource-intensive. Deforestation detection delayed. Wildlife habitat assessment lacking spatial precision.

## Our Solution

**Comprehensive Forest Monitoring System** using satellite and drone imagery with change detection algorithms and habitat modeling for conservation.

### Technology Stack

- **Multispectral satellite imagery** for large-area coverage
- **NDVI forest health analysis** tracking vegetation conditions
- **Change detection algorithms** for deforestation alerts
- **Species distribution modeling** for wildlife corridors
- **Fire risk mapping** with predictive analytics

### Key Capabilities

- Timely deforestation detection enabling enforcement action
- Forest health trend analysis for management planning
- Wildlife corridor identification for conservation
- Fire risk assessment and prevention planning

## Benefits

- **Timely deforestation detection** (within 2-3 weeks of activity)
- **Forest health trend analysis** for management decisions
- **Wildlife corridor identification** supporting biodiversity
- **Fire risk assessment** enabling proactive prevention

## Target Clients

State forest departments, environmental regulatory agencies, conservation NGOs, wildlife authorities.

## Get Started

Protect forest resources with satellite-powered monitoring and conservation planning.
