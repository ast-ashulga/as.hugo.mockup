## Challenge

Pipeline corridor monitoring over long distances difficult. Right-of-way encroachment detection delayed. Leak detection relies on manual inspection.

## Our Solution

**Comprehensive Pipeline Monitoring System** using corridor surveillance, automated encroachment detection, and thermal leak detection integration.

### Technology Stack

- **Pipeline corridor mapping** with drone and satellite imagery
- **Thermal imaging for leak detection**
- **Change detection for encroachment** monitoring
- **GPS patrol tracking** for inspection routes
- **SCADA spatial integration** for operational data

### Key Capabilities

- Early encroachment detection preventing third-party damage
- Systematic pipeline integrity monitoring
- Environmental compliance documentation
- Emergency response planning

## Benefits

- **Early encroachment detection** preventing costly damage
- **Systematic pipeline integrity monitoring** reducing leak risk
- **Environmental compliance documentation** with geo-referenced evidence
- **Emergency response planning** with spatial intelligence

## Target Clients

Oil and gas transmission companies, petroleum pipeline authorities, CNG distribution networks.

## Get Started

Protect pipeline infrastructure with comprehensive spatial monitoring and leak detection.
