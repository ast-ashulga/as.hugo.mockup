## Challenge

After natural disasters—cyclones, floods, earthquakes—state disaster management authorities face critical pressure to assess damage quickly and distribute relief efficiently. Traditional challenges include:

- **Manual ground surveys** take 15-30 days, delaying compensation
- **Limited accessibility** to remote or unsafe areas (only 60-70% coverage)
- **Visual estimates** create 30-40% error margins, leading to disputes
- **Incomplete photographic evidence** complicates insurance claims

Gujarat's 1,600 km coastline faces cyclone exposure, 15+ districts experience annual monsoon flooding, and Kutch region remains in seismic Zone V.

## Our Solution

**AI-Powered Rapid Damage Assessment System** using all-weather drones, thermal imaging, and automated damage classification to deliver comprehensive disaster area intelligence within 5-7 days.

### Technology Stack

- **All-weather drones** (DJI Matrice 30T) with thermal + RGB cameras
- **RTK capability** for precision mapping in flooded areas
- **Building damage classification** (YOLOv8 trained on disaster imagery)
- **Flood depth estimation** using thermal + RGB fusion
- **GSDMA SEOC dashboard** integration for real-time updates
- **Revenue Department** land records for beneficiary verification

### Key Capabilities

#### Immediate Post-Disaster Reconnaissance
Deploy drone teams within 2-4 hours of disaster event. Priority flights over critical infrastructure and population centers. Rapid reconnaissance covering 100-200 hectares per hour identifies damage hotspots for ground team prioritization.

#### Comprehensive Damage Mapping
Systematic grid flights covering all affected talukas. High-resolution imagery (2-3 cm/pixel) captures building-level detail. Thermal imaging detects survivors in collapsed structures and identifies structural compromises invisible to RGB cameras.

#### AI-Automated Damage Classification
Machine learning models analyze 10,000+ structures daily. Automated damage severity scoring (0-100% loss estimation). Change detection compares post-disaster imagery with baseline pre-disaster maps. Agricultural crop loss calculated through NDVI analysis.

#### Verification & Report Generation
Ground truth validation of 10-15% AI classifications ensures accuracy. Cross-reference with revenue records for beneficiary identification. Automated compensation calculations based on damage severity categories.

#### Relief Coordination Dashboard
GSDMA dashboard displays structure-level damage data on interactive maps. Prioritized beneficiary lists sorted by damage severity and vulnerability. Integration with financial systems for direct fund transfer.

## Benefits

### For Disaster Management Authority
- **Accelerated assessment**: 5-7 days vs. traditional 15-30 days
- **Complete coverage**: 95-100% of affected areas including remote zones
- **Objective evidence**: Geo-referenced imagery eliminates subjective assessments
- **Financial accuracy**: ±5-10% errors vs. traditional ±30-40%

### For Affected Citizens
- **Faster relief**: 10-23 day reduction in compensation timeline
- **Fair assessment**: Objective AI analysis ensures consistent treatment
- **Insurance support**: Comprehensive drone imagery accelerates claims (7-10 days vs. 30-45 days)

## Implementation Approach

### Preparedness Phase (Ongoing - Before Disaster)
- Pre-disaster baseline imagery for 25-30 high-risk talukas
- Position drone teams at strategic locations (Bhuj, Rajkot, Surat, Gandhinagar)
- 24/7 standby protocol during monsoon season (June-September)
- GSDMA SEOC dashboard integration and coordination protocols

### Event Response (Disaster-Triggered)
- **Hour 0-2**: GSDMA activates drone teams, mobilization to affected region
- **Hour 2-24**: Priority flights and rapid reconnaissance
- **Day 1-3**: Comprehensive survey with systematic grid flights
- **Day 2-4**: AI analysis processing thousands of structures
- **Day 4-5**: Ground truth verification and beneficiary confirmation
- **Day 5-7**: Relief distribution with comprehensive assessment report

## Use Case Scenarios

### Post-Cyclone Coastal Village Assessment
**Traditional**: 3-4 day delay to reach villages, manual inspection, 60% coverage, 10-15 day report compilation
**With Setu GIS**: Drones deployed within 4 hours, 100% coverage including flooded areas, AI processes 847 structures, comprehensive report in 5 days

### Agricultural Crop Damage for Insurance
**Traditional**: 3-4 week field officer visits, months-long claims processing, subjective estimation disputes
**With Setu GIS**: Satellite imagery within 2-3 days, automated NDVI change detection, 7-day reports, claims processed in 3-4 weeks

### Urban Flood Damage Prioritization
**Traditional**: Respond to 108 calls as received, no systematic prioritization of vulnerable populations
**With Setu GIS**: Thermal imaging identifies occupied buildings, cross-reference with vulnerable facility database, priority rescue list generated with optimized routing

## Target Clients

- **State Disaster Management Authorities**: GSDMA and equivalent authorities in other states
- **National Disaster Response Force**: NDRF teams requiring rapid damage intelligence
- **Insurance Companies**: Crop insurance (PMFBY), property insurance for objective assessment

## Get Started

Ensure disaster-ready response with AI-powered drone assessment delivering comprehensive damage mapping within 5-7 days.
