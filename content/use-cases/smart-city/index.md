            The Metropolitan Planning Authority needed to modernize their urban development approach to 
            accommodate rapid population growth while optimizing resource allocation. Traditional 
            planning methods were insufficient for predicting the complex interactions between 
            infrastructure, population density, and resource demands.

            We developed an integrated geospatial platform combining satellite imagery, demographic data, 
            infrastructure maps, and predictive algorithms. The solution included:
            
            - Real-time population density mapping using mobile and satellite data
            - Predictive modeling for infrastructure demand (water, electricity, transportation)
            - Interactive dashboards for scenario planning and resource allocation
            - Automated reporting system for city planning committees

            The platform enabled the authority to make data-driven decisions that improved urban 
            development efficiency:
            
            - 30% improvement in resource allocation effectiveness
            - 25% reduction in infrastructure development timeline
            - 40% better prediction accuracy for population growth and resource needs
            - Improved public satisfaction with urban services
