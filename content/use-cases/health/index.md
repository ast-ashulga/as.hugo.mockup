## Challenge

Disease outbreak tracking lacks spatial context. Healthcare facility accessibility analysis inadequate for planning. Resource allocation not optimized geographically.

## Our Solution

**Public Health Spatial Intelligence Platform** for disease surveillance, healthcare accessibility analysis, and resource allocation optimization.

### Technology Stack

- **Epidemiological mapping** for outbreak tracking
- **Hotspot analysis** for disease pattern identification
- **Drive-time service area calculations** for accessibility
- **Demographic health data integration**
- **Mobile health worker tracking**

### Key Capabilities

- Early outbreak detection through spatial pattern analysis
- Equitable healthcare resource distribution
- Ambulance/mobile clinic route optimization
- Data-driven facility location planning

## Benefits

- **Early outbreak detection** enabling rapid response
- **Equitable healthcare resource distribution** based on spatial analysis
- **Ambulance route optimization** reducing response times
- **Data-driven facility planning** for underserved areas

## Target Clients

State health departments, municipal health offices, hospitals, epidemiology research institutes.

## Get Started

Enhance public health outcomes with spatial disease surveillance and accessibility analysis.
