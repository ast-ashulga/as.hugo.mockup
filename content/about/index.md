      title: Company Overview
      text: |
        **"We believe spatial data should drive smarter decisions across government and enterprise."**

        Our mission is to democratize access to geospatial intelligence by delivering custom GIS solutions that transform raw spatial data into actionable insights. We help organizations leverage location intelligence for improved planning, operational efficiency, and evidence-based decision-making.

        Founded with a focus on addressing India's unique geospatial challenges, Setu Geo Spatial emerged from recognition that government departments and enterprises needed more than off-the-shelf GIS toolsâ€”they required customized spatial intelligence platforms built specifically for Indian operational contexts, regulatory frameworks, and integration requirements.

        Our name "Setu" (Sanskrit for "bridge") reflects our role: bridging advanced geospatial technology with practical government and enterprise applications. Based in Gujarat, we bring deep understanding of Indian government procurement processes, compliance requirements, and multi-department coordination challenges.
